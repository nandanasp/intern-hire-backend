He has a solid understanding of frontend technologies like TypeScript, Angular, React, and React Native. His experience with NestJS and ExpressJS demonstrates his backend knowledge, which is valuable for full-stack development. He has also worked on projects involving containerization tools like Docker, which is a plus. His experience with Git and version control is evident from his work on various projects. However, his experience with AngularJS might be less relevant for this internship, which focuses on Angular 11+. Overall, Sumrender's skills and experience align well with the requirements of the internship.",
